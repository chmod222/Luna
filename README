Luna is a small IRC Bot written in C with very few external dependencies (libc,
lua) that interfaces with Lua scripts both as initial and runtime configuration

Current core features done:
  * Handling core events such as JOIN, PART, QUIT and updating the
    global state accordingly to keep a snychronized list of users
  * Keep-alive
  * Lua driven initial configuration
  * User management
  * Lua script support, loadable on runtime

Luna is written to run on UNIX-like operating systems (and tested on Linux),
but it should be easy to port to other systems.

Luna loads users from the "users.txt" file. Each line in the file as a user
and his/her level of permissions, separated by a ':' like:

foo!bar@baz:admin

Wildcards are suported, so the following is possible:

foo!*@baz:admin
f?o!b*@baz:admin

Because the level is a string, scripts are free to interpret them as they want,
allowing more fine-grained control of who is allowed to do what, or using the
userlist to categorize users (Friendlists, Blacklists, ...)
