Luna is a small IRC Bot written in C with very few external dependencies (libc,
lua 5.2) that interfaces with Lua scripts both as initial and runtime
configuration

Features:
  * Lua driven initial configuration
  * User management
  * Lua scripting support, loadable on runtime, with a pretty full featured
    standard library (See API_Documentation.txt)

Luna is written to run on UNIX-like operating systems (and tested on Linux),
but it should be easy to port to other systems.

Luna reads users from the "users.txt" file. Each line in the file as a user,
his/her permission flags and an optional level, separated by a ':' like:

id:foo!bar@baz:flags:level

Wildcards are suported, so the following is possible:

foo!*@baz:o:admin
f?o!b*@baz:o:admin
