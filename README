Luna is a small IRC Bot written in C with very few external dependencies (libc,
lua) that interfaces with Lua scripts both as initial and runtime configuration

Current core features done:
  * Handling core events such as JOIN, PART, QUIT and updating the
    global state accordingly to keep a snychronized list of users
  * Keep-alive
  * Lua driven initial configuration

Features not done yet:
  * User management
  * The actual script support

Luna is written to run on UNIX-like operating systems (and tested on Linux),
but it should be easy to port to other systems.
